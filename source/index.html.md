# Introduction

Welcome to the FlowCommand API. You can use our API to access information on your FlowCommand flow sensors and pings (sensor readings) from those sensors.

# Authentication
FlowCommand supports two types of authentication - Token Auth and Basic Auth. All requests must be authenticated using one of the two schemes.

You can request security credentials from your FlowCommand representative.

### Token Auth
> To authorize with Token Auth, use this code:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl https://app.flowcommand.com/api-path
  -H "Authorization: Token api-auth-token"
```

> Make sure to replace `api-auth-token` with your API key.

With Token Auth, FlowCommand expects for the API key to be included in all API requests as an HTTP header like:

`Authorization: Token api-auth-token`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>api-auth-token</code> with your personal API key.
</aside>

### Basic Auth

> To authorize with Basic Auth, use this code:

```shell
curl https://username:password@app.flowcommand.com/api-path

OR

curl https://app.flowcommand.com/api-path
  -H "Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ="
```

> Make sure to replace `username` and `password` with your API credentials.

With Basic Auth you can include your username and password in the URL like:
`https://username:password@app.flowcommand.com/api-path`

Alternatively you can pass the Basic Auth credentials as an Authorization header. Make sure to base 64 encode your credentials formatted as "username:password" and include them in an HTTP header:

`Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=`

# Flow Sensors

## Get All Flow Sensors

# Webhook Endpoints
Set up a webhook endpoint in order to receive a POST request each time an incoming transmission is received. Each request will include the following data:

```json
{
  "type": "ping_received",
  "api_version": "1",
	"data": {
		"id": 2,
		"sensor_id": 1,
		"sensor_name": "Sensor 1",
		"flowrate": 0.0,
		"datetime": "2019-02-05T19:44:09Z"
	}
}
```

To add a webhook endpoint, go to the webhook configuration tool at https://app.flowcommand.com/app/developers

Each webhook POST request will include an authentication HTTP header. The header name is "FC-Signature" and the secret value is shown in the webhook configuration tool.
